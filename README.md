# Image-Denoising-Using-CNN
Recovering meaningful information from noisy images to restore the true image for obtaining high quality images using CNNs

## Introduction
Image denoising is to remove noise from a noisy image, so as to restore the true image. However, since noise, edge, and texture are high frequency components, it is difficult to distinguish them in the process of denoising and the denoised images could inevitably lose some details. With the presence of noise, possible subsequent image processing tasks, such as video processing, image analysis, and tracking, are adversely affected. Therefore, image denoising plays an important role in modern image processing systems.
The state-of-the-art deep learning denoising methods, typically based on CNNs are in rapid use today. Our aim is to use CNN on the training and testing data to help denoise the input image.
